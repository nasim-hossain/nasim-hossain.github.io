      <section>
        <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
        <p>I believe in fostering a learning environment that encourages critical thinking, hands-on problem solving, and interdisciplinary collaboration. My approach combines theoretical foundations with practical applications, helping students develop both conceptual understanding and technical proficiency. Drawing from my experience in both academia and industry, I emphasize the real-world relevance of engineering principles and computational methods.</p>
